# Step Functions Challenge

### Challenge goal

Process only orders from locations in the EU (eu-west or eu-east) using a AWS Step Functions target (OrderProcessing). In this use case, we are demonstrating how a Step Function execution can be triggered to process orders as they are published by the Orders bus.

## Step 1: Implement an EventBridge rule to target Step Functions
Use the EventBridge Console to:

Add a rule to the Orders event bus with the name EUOrdersRule
Define an event pattern to match events with a detail location in eu-west or eu-east
Target the OrderProcessing Step Functions state machine
Here is a sample event to reference when writing the event pattern:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

{
    "version": "0",
    "id": "6e6b1f6d-48f8-5dff-c2d2-a6f22c2e0086",
    "detail-type": "Order Notification",
    "source": "com.aws.orders",
    "account": "111111111111",
    "time": "2020-02-23T15:35:41Z",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "resources": [],
    "detail": {
        "category": "office-supplies",
        "value": 300,
        "location": "eu-west"
    }
}

Step 2: Send test EU Orders events
Using the Send events function, send the following Order Notification events from the source com.aws.orders:

1
{ "category": "office-supplies", "value": 300, "location": "eu-west" }

1
{ "category": "tech-supplies", "value": 3000, "location": "eu-east" }

Step 3: Verify Step Functions workflow execution
If the event sent to the Orders event bus matches the pattern in your rule, then the event will be sent to the OrderProcessing Step Functions state machine for execution.

Open the AWS Management Console for Step Functions  in a new tab or window, so you can keep this step-by-step guide open.

On the Step Functions homepage, open the left hand navigation and select State machines.

Enter OrderProcessing in the Search for state machines box and verify the state machine execution has succeeded.

The Step Functions state machine will publish an OrderProcessed event back to the Orders event bus, using a new Service Integration for EventBridge which provides a simpler solution for producing events during a workflow execution. We will make use of this event later in the workshop. If you would like to see more detail on the workflow execution, select OrderProcessing from the list of state machines, and then select the workflow execution from the list.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Step Functions Challenge.
Extra credit
Implement an event pattern using Prefix Matching  that matches events with a location the begins with eu-. Do not modify the Step Function target and verify backwards compatibility by reusing the sample data above. Modify the test data to use a location, eu-south, to verify that additional EU locations trigger execution of the Step Functions state machine.
Extra credit
Implement an event pattern using Prefix Matching  and Numeric Matching  that matches events with a location the begins with eu- AND an Order value greater than 1000. Do not modify the Step Function target and verify backwards compatibility by reusing the sample data above.
